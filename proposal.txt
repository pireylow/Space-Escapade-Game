TITLE: 
Space Escapade

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
This game is modelled after the 'Tilt to Live' game. The user will control a spaceship to avoid and kill enemies that chase after
it in the game. Multiple powers will spawn in space for the user to use to eliminate these enemies. The longer one survives and the 
more enemies one kills, the more points he will score!

SIMILAR PROJECTS:
This is modelled after the tilt to live game but there are no similar projects online. This game will include similar features 
and user experience. 

The user will be an arrow and uses either 'WASD' keys or mouse drag to control the direction and movement of the arrow. There will
be red dots ('enemy') that appear at regular points in time of regular quantities. They will approach the arrow via the shortest
possible path and if they collide with the user, the game is over. However, there will be power-ups that appear at regular points 
in time on the map as well which can be used to kill the red dots when the user picks them up. Points will be added when red dots 
are killed (combos give more points), a power-up is picked up and a certain period of time has passed. Difficulty will be increased 
over time by increasing the number of red dots and the speed at which they approach the user.

## Space Escapade

This game is modeled after the 'Tilt to Live' game. The user will control a spaceship to avoid and kill enemies that chase after it in the game. Multiple powers will spawn in space for the user to use to eliminate these enemies. The longer one survives and the more enemies one kills, the more points he will score!
